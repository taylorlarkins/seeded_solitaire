## Seeded Solitaire
The year is 2024. Every member of my family has developed a serious addiction to Google Solitaire. We are starting to become quite competitive. But it is hard to determine who is truly the best at this game of *immense skill* when every game is determined by a different one of the seemingly endless possible arrangements of a deck of face cards. What if you could compete against your family and friends on *the same shuffle?* That is the purpose of this project: creating a fair means for friendly family solitaire competition. Because not every game is winnable (and you tend to lose most games that are anyways), a scoring mechanic will help you determine who is truly the best solitarire player, even when you lose.

## Project Trajectory
For now, I plan on starting out pretty small by building a simple HTML/JS/CSS page that can produce solitaire shuffles based on an inputed seed. Should I find the time, my next step would be to flesh things out using React. Perhaps I'll even take things a step further and host the page on a server and implement additional features, such as a daily solitaire shuffle with a global leaderboard. Who knows.

## Current State of the Project
Creating the simple interface and logic for playing the game.

## Additional Features to Implement (Motivation Dependent)
- Improved shuffle seeding
- Better UI design (w/ React)
- Improved controls/keyboard shortcuts for easier gameplay
- Game statistics tracking
- Online play (host page to a server)
- Daily Shuffle with global leaderboard
